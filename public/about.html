  In addition to my academic background, I am actively expanding my skill set by delving into full-stack web development.
   This comprehensive approach encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies, enabling me to build complete, dynamic web applications. On the front end, I am honing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Simultaneously, I am exploring back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express.js to develop robust server-side logic and manage databases effectively.
    By integrating these technologies, I aim to create seamless and efficient web solutions that enhance user experiences and meet diverse business needs.â€‹
